        <p>Some people are unaware that numerous African nations have English as an official language.<br>
            This lack of awareness often stems from insufficient global education regarding Africa's diverse cultures and linguistic landscapes.<br>
            Acknowledging this fact serves to dismantle stereotypes and highlights the cultural and linguistic richness of the African continent.<br>
            When people think of English-speaking countries, they typically envision nations such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada or Australia. Some African countries not only employ English in educational and governmental institutions but also in everyday communication.</p>
